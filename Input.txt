Customer Support Ticket #12847
Date: January 28, 2026
Agent: Sarah Mitchell (sarah.mitchell@techsupport.com)

CUSTOMER COMPLAINT:
I ordered a laptop from your website at https://www.techstore.com/laptops on 
January 15th. The total was $1,299.99 but I was charged $1,499.99 on my credit 
card ending in 4532 8765 1234 9876.

I've been trying to reach customer service at (555) 123-4567 but nobody answers. 
I also sent an email to support@techstore.com three days ago with no response.

The order confirmation said it would arrive by 2:30 PM on January 20th, but it's 
now January 28th and I still haven't received anything.
